    <h1>SCALED: SCALable gEnerative founDational model for Computational Physics</h1>
    <p>In this work, we introduce SCALED, a scalable foundational neural network built upon a diffusion-based generative framework for computational physics. Drawing on inspiration from numerical solvers, SCALED incorporates both grid invariance and geometry invariance, allowing it to be trained on smaller subdomains while generalising to larger domains of arbitrary resolution and geometry. Domain decomposition can be included within the SCALED model, enabling multiple GPUs to be used to accelerate inference or to infer for domains of a larger size. Leveraging its generative foundation and U-Net-based architecture, SCALED excels at capturing high-frequency information, outperforming state-of-the-art data-driven methods in both statistical and qualitative measures. To showcase its capabilities, we demonstrate SCALED on three urban flow scenarios with a complex configuration of buildings, demonstrating its robustness and stability. Beyond delivering accurate velocity predictions at fine spatial and temporal scales, SCALED also shows strong potential for public health applications, such as monitoring and mitigating air pollution in urban environments.</p>
